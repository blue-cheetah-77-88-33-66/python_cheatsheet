Things to know about python

<h2>Python Collections (Arrays)</h2>
There are four collection data types in the Python programming language:

+<b>List</b> is a collection which is ordered and changeable. Allows duplicate members.

+<b>Tuple</b> is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. Allows duplicate members.

+<b>Set</b> is a collection which is unordered, unchangeable*, and unindexed. No duplicate members.

+<b>Dictionary</b> is a collection which is ordered** and changeable. No duplicate members.

*Set items are unchangeable, but you can remove and/or add items whenever you like.

**As of Python version 3.7, dictionaries are ordered. In Python 3.6 and earlier, dictionaries are unordered.

<b>When choosing a collection type, it is useful to understand the properties of that type. Choosing the right type for a particular data set could mean retention of meaning, and, it could mean an increase in efficiency or security.</b>
